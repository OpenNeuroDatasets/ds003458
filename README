  23 subjects taking the 3-armed bandit task with oscillating probabilities.  The 3 subjs who did poorly are not included here (or in the paper).  Task included in Matlab programming language.   Data collected in 2014 in the Cognitive Rhythms and Computation Lab, University of New Mexico.   I also collected Corrugator EMG (may be labeled EKG) and Skin Conductance on most people.  But quality was dubious so I never did much with it.  Check .xls sheet.   - James F Cavanagh 01/04/2021
